abstract: Internal migrants account for over one-fourth of China's population,
  and their saving behavior is important in explaining “the Chinese saving
  puzzle”. The relation between household savings and house prices has been
  studied, but this paper utilizes a quasi-experiment that removed home purchase
  restrictions to examine the causal effect of homeownership on migrant
  household savings through a difference-in-differences approach and
  instrumental variable estimation. We find that the migrant saving rate
  significantly decreases after migrants buy houses, falling below that of the
  local hukou population. Further analysis reveals that this effect of
  homeownership can be explained by the consumption effect rather than housing
  purchase or increased household income effects. Our findings imply that
  hukou-based policies, including the allocation of public goods and the right
  to buy private goods such as houses, will harm both migrant welfare and
  sustained economic growth.
