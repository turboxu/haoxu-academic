abstract: Boosting domestic demand is the task of China's sustainable economic
  development, and in particular, China has become an important global consumer
  market and the savings patterns should be more cohesive and without
  discriminations. Using data of China Migrants Dynamic Survey, the paper
  provides new evidence on internal migrants’ savings in China from the
  perspective of homeownership and family migration. We find that migrants’
  savings are 5.25–6.60 percentage points higher than hukou population even when
  controlling for working, social status, and social insurance coverage which
  means the migrant will save 1019.88–1647.10 yuan in 2010 price more monthly.
  Furthermore, we discover housing could partly explain the saving gap, while
  when we take remittance and family migration into account, the saving rate
  differences between migrants and hukou population disappears, which means
  migrants may save to consume when they go back to their hometown with their
  family members instead of consuming later in the resident cities. The research
  is carried out taking into account the objectives of social cohesion policy
  identified at national and international level and their involvement in
  consumption and saving processes. Our empirical results reveal that
  homeownership, remittance motive and family migration play important roles in
  shaping saving behaviour of migrants.
